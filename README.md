# OOP.Assignment2

In this project we are implementing and practicing the ‘observer’ design pattern. 
We have an admin that holds an UndoableStringBuilder, and we have the members that know what is the status of the string builder. 

## Deeply into the project

In the project we have 6 classes.

**for the admin
1. An interface class called Sender - contains all the method that are needed for managing the Undoable String Builder
2. The GroupAdmin class that implements the Sender interface - the group admin holds the list of members and the status of the string builder
3. The GroupAdminTest - contains tests for the Group Admin class. 
**for the observers(members)
4. An inteface class called Member - contain the update method. 
5. The concreteMember class that implements the Member interface - that implements the update method for the members (and inheirtace a toString)
6. The concreteMemberTest - contains tests for the concreteMember class.
